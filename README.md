# Sensorbox 2

## Introduction

The **Sensorbox 2** measures the current (A) and current direction for up to three phases using CTs (current transformers) and a mains voltage input. Alternatively, it can receive these measurements directly from a (D)SMR5 smart meter via the P1 port. These measurements are then sent every two seconds to the connected SmartEVSE(s) to support smart EV charging.
